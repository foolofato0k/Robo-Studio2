# Image Processor Tests

This subsystem is fully implemented in the project under robo_da_vinci and the project wiki includes more detailed information on how the subsystem runs.
This folder only serves to show the subsystem's progress in development under archive and the subsystem tests, which can be run independently here.

## Subsystem Tests
The **test_imgProcessor** folder includes:
- TESTS.ipynb file of the tests. - Running instructions are found in the file

## Requirements
The subsystem requirements include:

OpenCV-Python: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html

Matplotlib: https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/

PyPotrace: https://pypi.org/project/pypotrace/
- the above is a python API for the Potrace Library: https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/22.04/ubuntu-universe-arm64/potrace_1.16-2_arm64.deb.html
